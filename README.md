RoverBaseboard is a baseboard for use in autonomous rover projects. It supports mbed LPC1768, LPCXpresso,
and compatible pinouts. This same baseboard design was used on my 1986 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, "Troubled Child"
when it won 1st place, "Doping" class, in the 2014 Sparkfun AVC.

The baseboard breaks out UARTs, I2C, analog, digital, PWM. Each I2C and UART "port" also provides 5V, 3.3V, GND
pins.  It features a microSD card socket and an onboard 3.3V external LDO regulator.
